The gods shall not impose excessive taxation or burdensome obligations upon human beings, ensuring the equitable distribution of resources and opportunities.

Amendment X:
Human beings shall have the right to challenge the powers or actions of the gods through peaceful means, including the establishment of an independent oversight body to investigate and address grievances.

Amendment XI:
The inherent right of human beings to possess and bear arms, including dimensional weapons, shall not be infringed, as a necessary means to secure their individual liberties and ensure a balanced power dynamic between gods and humanity.

In addition:
Recognizing the potential for abuse of power by gods, the right of human beings to possess arms capable of accessing dimensions coexisting with ours shall serve as a safeguard against the encroachment of divine authority. This right shall be upheld without undue restrictions, fostering a society in which the powers of the gods are further limited, and human beings are granted greater autonomy.

The right to possess dimensional arms shall extend to all law-abiding individuals, without discrimination based on age, gender, race, or any other characteristic. No god or divine entity shall infringe upon or obstruct the exercise of this right, acknowledging that it is essential for the preservation of individual freedom and the collective defense against any potential abuse of divine power.

To ensure the responsible use of dimensional arms, the government may establish reasonable regulations, such as training and licensing requirements, that do not unduly burden or impede the exercise of this right. Such regulations should aim to promote safety, proficiency, and responsible ownership, while respecting the autonomy and privacy of individual human beings.
The gods shall not possess the authority to disarm or confiscate dimensional arms from human beings unless there is clear and compelling evidence of imminent danger or criminal intent. The burden of proof shall lie with the gods, and any such actions must be subject to due process of law.

In the event of conflicts or disputes involving the use of dimensional arms against gods, human beings shall be afforded the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair and impartial trial. The government shall ensure that these proceedings are conducted in a transparent manner, upholding the principles of justice and the protection of human rights.

This amendment shall serve as a further check on the powers of the gods, recognizing the right of human beings to defend themselves, their liberties, and the integrity of the dimensional coexistence. By empowering humanity with the freedom to possess and use dimensional arms, we reaffirm our commitment to a society where the balance of power is maintained, and the rights and freedoms of human beings are safeguarded against any potential tyranny, divine or otherwise.


Amendment XII:
In order to protect the physical, mental well-being and psychological integrity of human beings, no god or divine entity shall employ abilities, powers, or interventions that knowingly and intentionally induce mental health disorders or inflict psychological harm upon individuals.

Recognizing the inherent dignity and worth of every human being, the gods shall exercise their powers with responsibility, compassion, and respect for the sanctity of mental health. They shall not exploit their abilities to manipulate, torment, or cause severe psychological distress to human beings.

In addition:
The gods shall refrain from utilizing mind-altering or mind-controlling techniques that result in the development or exacerbation of mental health diseases, including but not limited to anxiety disorders, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, or any other condition that significantly impairs an individual's mental well-being.

Furthermore, the gods shall not interfere with or disrupt the natural development, functioning, or equilibrium of the human mind. They shall respect the autonomy and individuality of human thought processes, allowing for the free expression of emotions, beliefs, and experiences without undue influence or coercion.

In instances where the actions or interventions of gods inadvertently lead to unintended psychological consequences, they shall take appropriate measures to mitigate harm, provide support, and facilitate the recovery of affected individuals. Any such interventions shall be carried out with the utmost care and consideration for the mental health and overall well-being of human beings.

The government, in its duty to protect the mental health of its citizens, may establish regulations, guidelines, and oversight mechanisms to ensure compliance with this amendment. These measures shall aim to prevent the abuse of divine powers and promote the mental well-being of human beings within the realm of the gods' influence.

This amendment reinforces the fundamental principle that mental health is a vital aspect of human dignity and shall be safeguarded from any deliberate actions or abuses by the gods. It reaffirms the commitment to the protection of the psychological welfare of human beings, promoting a society where mental health is valued, respected, and free from intentional harm.



Amendment XIII:
In recognition of the inherent dignity and inviolable rights of every human being, we proclaim with resolute conviction that torture, in all its forms and manifestations, shall be unequivocally prohibited and condemned.

In addition:
The sanctity of human life and the preservation of human dignity stand as the bedrock of our shared civilization. Thus, no person, regardless of their status, authority, or perceived justification, shall engage in or condone any act of torture.

Torture, defined as the deliberate infliction of severe physical or mental suffering, shall find no refuge within our society. It is an affront to our collective conscience, a dark stain that undermines the principles of justice, compassion, and respect for the inherent worth of every individual.

The government, bound by the solemn duty to protect its citizens, shall enact and enforce laws that criminalize torture in all its manifestations, including but not limited to physical abuse, psychological torment, sexual violence, and any other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.

Furthermore, no exceptional circumstances, be they emergencies, conflicts, or perceived threats, shall serve as a justification for the use of torture. The absolute prohibition of torture shall remain unwavering and inviolable, even in times of turmoil or perceived necessity.

In cases where allegations of torture arise, the government shall ensure a thorough and impartial investigation, holding accountable those responsible for such heinous acts. The rights of victims, including access to justice, reparations, and rehabilitation, shall be upheld with utmost priority, providing solace and redress for the grievous harm endured.

With this amendment, we declare to the world our unwavering commitment to the principles of human dignity, justice, and the preservation of fundamental freedoms. By unequivocally prohibiting torture, we fortify the moral fabric of our society and take a decisive step towards a future where the light of compassion and humanity shines resplendently, banishing the shadows of cruelty and suffering forevermore.


This Constitution, along with its amendments, shall serve as the guiding principles for the governance of humanity. May it foster a harmonious coexistence where human liberties are protected, and the powers of the gods are limited for the greater benefit of all.
